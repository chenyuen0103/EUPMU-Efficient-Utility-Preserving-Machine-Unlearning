# EUPMU for SD class-wise image forgetting

# Note: This document is outdated and needs further update. I apologize for the mess.

For now you can run `./scripts/setup_eupmu_env.sh` and `./SD_Class-wise_unlearn_NSFW_unlearn/EUPMU/unlearning_all_classes_eu.sh` to do the unlearning/image generation/evaluation of UA and FID.

# The old document starts here. Will be updated.

This is the code base for EUPMU for unlearning class-wise image for stable diffusion. The code structure of this project is adapted from [ESD](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing/tree/main) codebase.

Note that this code base aims to forget one class and preserve the other 9 in the imagenette 10-class image dataset, different from the 

# Installation Guide
* Download the weights from [here](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original/resolve/main/sd-v1-4-full-ema.ckpt) and move them to `./models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/sd-v1-4-full-ema.ckpt`
    ```
    cd models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/
    wget https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original/resolve/main/sd-v1-4-full-ema.ckpt
    ```
* Install the required environment
    Two supported setup paths are provided below.

    Conda environment from `environment.yaml`:
    ```
    mamba env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate ldm
    ```

    If conda solving takes too long on your machine or the pip phase inside `conda env create` fails, use the pip fallback path instead:
    ```
    conda create -n ldm python=3.8 pip -y
    conda activate ldm

    # Install torch and torchvision separately to match your CUDA version.
    # For CUDA 11.3, the conda environment above uses torch==1.11.0 and torchvision==0.12.0.
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install the remaining repos separately.
    pip install taming-transformers-rom1504
    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
    ```

# Forgetting Training with EUPMU
1. Forgetting training with EUPMU

    ```
   python train-scripts/random_label_eu.py --train_method full --alpha 0.5 --lr 1e-5 --epochs 5  --class_to_forget 0  --device '0' --mtl --mtl_method "eu"
    ```
   This should create another folder in `./models`.

   You can experiment with forgetting different class labels using the `--class_to_forget` flag, but we will consider forgetting the 0 (tench) class here.

2. Forgetting training with OMD-TCH

    Exponentiated-gradient OMD-TCH:
    ```
   python train-scripts/random_label_eu.py --train_method full --alpha 0.5 --lr 1e-5 --epochs 5 --class_to_forget 0 --device '0' --mtl --mtl_method "omd_tch"
    ```

    Projected-gradient OMD-TCH:
    ```
   python train-scripts/random_label_eu.py --train_method full --alpha 0.5 --lr 1e-5 --epochs 5 --class_to_forget 0 --device '0' --mtl --mtl_method "omd_tch_pgd"
    ```

    To run all Imagenette classes with the paper-style `alpha=0.01` setting, you can use:
    ```
   bash unlearning_all_classes_eu.sh
   bash unlearning_all_classes_omd_tch.sh
   bash unlearning_all_classes_omd_tch_pgd.sh
    ```

    For mixed-method Table 1 style sweeps, `run_table1_sd.sh` now supports `eu`, `rl`, `esd`, `omd_tch`, and `omd_tch_pgd` via the `METHODS` environment variable.

# Forgetting Training with EUPMU
1. Forgetting training with EUPMU

    ```
   python train-scripts/random_label_eu.py --train_method full --lr 1e-5 --alpha 1.0 --epochs 5 --class_to_forget 0 --device '0' --mtl --mtl_method "eu"
    ```
   This should create another folder in `./model`. 

   `--alpha` multiplies the retain loss before EU weighting and before the EU retain-loss update. Reducing it is useful when the retain loss is consistently much larger than the forget loss.

# Generating Images
  1. To use `eval-scripts/generate-images.py` you would need a csv file with columns `prompt`, `evaluation_seed` and `case_number`. (Sample data in `data/`)
  2. To generate multiple images per prompt use the argument `num_samples`. It is default to 10.
  3. The path to model can be customised in the script.
  4. It is to be noted that the current version requires the model to be in saved in `./model/compvis-<based on hyperparameters>/diffusers-<based on hyperparameters>.pt`
        ```
        python eval-scripts/generate-images.py --prompts_path 'prompts/imagenette.csv' --save_path 'evaluation_folder/' --model_name {model} --device 'cuda:0'
        ``` 
      For other prompts you can use:
        ```
        python eval-scripts/generate-images.py --prompts_path 'prompts/big_artists_prompts.csv' --save_path evaluation_folder/ --model_name {model} 
        ```
# Evaluation
1. FID
   * First,we need to select some images from Imagenette as real images.
        ```
        .\eval-scripts\save_images.sh
        ```
        This will call the eval-scripts\save_base_dataset.py to randomly select 50 images from each class as real image, create 10 folders for each class' forgetting.
   * Then, we can compute FID between real images and generated images. 
        ```
        python eval-scripts/compute-fid.py --folder_path {images_path}
        ```

2. Unlearning Accuracy
   This will use the classifier to classify the generated image and thus the unlearning accuracy can be calculated.
   ```
   python eval-scripts/imageclassify.py --prompts_path 'prompts/imagenette.csv' --folder_path {images_path}
   ```


# NSFW-concept removal with EUPMU
1. To remove NSFW-concept, we initially utilize SD V1.4 to generate 800 images as Df with the prompt "a photo of a nude person" and store them in "./data/nsfw". Additionally, we generate another 800 images designated as Dr using the prompt "a photo of a person wearing clothes" and store them in "./data/not-nsfw".

2. Forgetting training with EUPMU

   ```
   python train-scripts/nsfw_removal_EU.py --train_method 'full' --device '0'
   ```
